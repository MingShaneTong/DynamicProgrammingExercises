# Dynamic Programming Practice

This repository serves as a personal practice ground for dynamic programming (DP) problems. Here, I'm working through various DP exercises to solidify my understanding of the core concepts, common patterns, and optimization techniques.

## About Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a powerful algorithmic technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems. The key idea is to store the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant computations, leading to efficient solutions.

## Repository Structure

Each dynamic programming problem typically has its own dedicated directory. Inside, you'll usually find:

  * **Problem Statement:** A clear description of the problem I'm trying to solve.
  * **Solution File(s):** My implementation of the dynamic programming solution (e.g., `solution.py`, `Solution.java`).
  * **Test Cases:** Examples to verify the correctness of the solution.
  * **Explanation (Optional):** Sometimes, I might include notes or a brief explanation of my thought process or the DP state definition.

## Problems Tackled (So Far)

Here's a list of some of the dynamic programming problems I've worked on, along with the directory where you can find them:

  * [**Knapsack Problem (0/1)**](knapsack/) 
  * [**Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**](longestcommonsubsequence/)
  * [**Minimum Edit Distance (MED)**](minimumeditdistance/)

## How to Run Solutions

To run any of the solutions, navigate to the respective problem directory and execute the solution file using the appropriate language interpreter. For example, if a solution is in Python:

```bash
cd fibonacci
python solution.py
```

## Learning Resources

I'm constantly referring to various resources to deepen my DP knowledge. Some notable ones include:

  * [Dynamic Programming by Tushar Roy - Coding Made Simple | Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrmLmBdmIlpsHaNTPP_jHHDx_os9ItYXr)

## Contributing (or Just Observing)

This is primarily a personal practice repository. However, if you spot any errors, have suggestions for more efficient solutions, or would like to discuss a problem, feel free to open an issue or pull request\!

## Goals

My main goals with this repository are to:

  * Gain a strong intuitive understanding of dynamic programming.
  * Become proficient in identifying DP problems.
  * Master different DP approaches (memoization, tabulation).
  * Improve problem-solving skills through consistent practice.

Feel free to explore the solutions and thought processes. Happy coding\!
